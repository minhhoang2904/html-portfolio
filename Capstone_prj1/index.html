    <ul>
        <li>
            Research Topic “ Environbot - Remote river trash-picking robot”<br>Researcher
            <ul>
                <li>Created a simple remoted robot design to pick up trash in lakes or rivers where is loads of waste; therefore, it provides
                    environmental benefits and alleviates employees’ workload of environmental organization</li>
                <li>Utilized common materials on the market at affordable prices, and used the Archimedes Principle to estimate the
                    technical parameter of each part of the robot including two PVC buoys and trash storage. Regarding the wireless
                    remote system, we programmed a simple application connected to the robot through wifi. We assembled an additional
                    wifi router and a power control circuit to generate the power to two motor propellers.</li>
                <li>Prepared and filmed presentations to submit to the 2021 World Science, Environment and Engineering Competition
                    and the 2021 World Innovative Science Fair, receiving a silver medal and a gold medal correspondingly.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>
            Research Topic “ReMask-er! - Tearing machine for recycling medical disposable Hanoi, Vietnam
Face-mask into fiber cotton”<br>Researcher
            <ul>
                <li>Proposed alternative physical recycling process which reduces global warming when most people used heating process,
                    created a new way to recycle used masks in the cotton form</li>
                <li>Researched the materials of the medical face masks and found non–woven fabric made from polypropylene that has
                    broad applications but is unawakened by most people. Utilized a system of tearing rollers to turn masks into cotton
                    which was then pressed into an industrial filter plate.</li>
                <li>Acquired 2 tearing rollers systems and scrolling rollers. After decided the basic mechanism of the machine, we designed
                    the operating box to turn the machine into automatic</li>
                <li>Prepared and filmed a presentation to submit to the 2021 AI-jam US, receiving a gold medal.</li>
